# TopCoder
Solutions to TopCoder questions answered to practice my ability to problem solve in C++

In my first semester of Junior year in college, I studied abroad at University of Adelaide. One of the classes I took there was titled "Problem Solving and Software Development". This title was misleading. Mostly in the class we solved TopCoder problems of increasing difficulty while practicing our use of different algorithmic strategies (use it/lose it, greedy, etc.). However, I now have answers to many TopCoder exercises which demonstrate my ability to write solutions to problems in an Object Oriented programming language.
